Extensions with Methods I've Added to UIKit Classes

#### Note: I'm in the process of preparing this code for publishing here.

This is a collection of Swift class extensions to add functionality to UIKit classes. I've used these methods to either simplify functionality or debugging of UIKit code in my projects. See the documentation in each file for more detailed information on the methods added. Each file contains an extension for one UIKit class.
