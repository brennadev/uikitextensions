Extensions with Methods and Properties I've Added to UIKit Classes/Structs

This is a collection of Swift class/struct extensions to add functionality to UIKit classes/structs. I've used these methods to either simplify functionality or debugging of UIKit code in my projects. See the documentation in each file for more detailed information on the methods and properties added. Each file contains an extension for one UIKit class or group of related classes/structs.

#### Compatibility
* Xcode 9.4 or later
* iOS 11.4 or later
  * May work with previous iOS versions (by changing the deployment target) but hasn't been tested with those versions

#### See Also
I have a separate framework with extensions on Swift Standard Library types [here](https://github.com/brennadev/swiftstandardlibraryextensions).

#### Note to Potential Employers
Please contact me if you'd like to see more of the work I've done with this framework as I don't want to make it all public.
